# Backend Development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

This project was part of a tutorial by Will Alexander on OpenClassrooms, focused on backend development. The application is an online store where the backend API handles CRUD operations, authentication, and file uploads.

## Features

1. **Express Server**: Set up a web server with routes and controllers.
2. **CRUD with MongoDB**: Managed database operations using Mongoose.
3. **Authentication**: Secured the API with bcrypt for passwords and JWT for sessions.
4. **File Uploads**: Handled user file uploads with multer.

## Technologies

- **Language**: JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Framework**: Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Bcrypt, JWT
- **File Management**: Multer

## Learning Outcomes

- Built a RESTful API with Node.js and MongoDB.
- Implemented authentication and file management.

## Acknowledgements
